## Introduction

`sbt-tasks` is an `sbt` plugin that gives `sbt` project Rails/Rake like functionality to execute tasks directly in `sbt` with the full
classpath and dependencies loaded.  This means you can do awesome things like seed and reset databases, perform
migrations and other things that are project specific.

## Requirements

- [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) 0.13

## Installation

Add the following lines to ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/build.sbt or PROJECT_DIR/project/plugins.sbt

    resolvers += "yobreifca.se repository" at "http://yobriefca.se/maven"

    addSbtPlugin("se.yobriefca" % "sbt-tasks" % "0.3.16")

> ** Version numbers may not be accurate **

## Usage

There are 2 ways to create tasks - with and without args.  There isn't yet a simple one size fits all appraoch yet (this needs further design).

### Tasks (without args)

First of all create a `Task` in the `tasks` package (this is the default place and can be configured... see later).

A `Task` is simply a class that implements `Runnable` e.g.

    package tasks

    class Printy extends Runnable {
        def run = println("Useless Printy Task")
    }

Then in your `build.sbt` or `Build.scala` file (example shows `build.sbt`) import the plugin and `install` some tasks

    import se.yobriefca.SbtTasks._
    ...
    installTask("printy")
    ...

This allows you to do `sbt printy` on the command line to run the associated `Printy` task.

If you want to also add a bit of descriptive text for your task you can call `installTask` with an extra argument

    ...
    installTask("printy", "Prints a pointless message")
    ...

### Tasks (expecting arguments)

The only differences between tasks without args and ones with are that they are,

1. Installed different `installTaskWithArgs(<same_parameters_as_before>)`
2. Expect an `Array[String]` in their constructor

We can extend the `printy` task above to take arguments

    package tasks

    class Printy(args: Array[String]) extends Runnable {
        def run = args.foreach(println)
    }

Then install it like so,

     installTaskWithArgs("printy", "Prints a pointless message")
 
 Then in SBT we can call it like so,
 
    > printy arg1 arg2 arg3
    [run-task] printy
    arg1 
    arg2 
    arg3
    [success] Total time: 0 s, completed ...
    
The whole thing tries to be as helpful as possible when you try and install a task expecting args with `installTask` or a task not expecting args with `installTaskWithArgs`.  __This needs careful review as it affects clobbing of arguments between the two commands and may be refactored later__

### Wait so how does `sbt-tasks` know what task to run?

Good question.  It uses the defined package name (defaulting to `tasks`) and the convention of
`taskname.captialize` - so `printy` will call `tasks.Printy`.

## Configuration

There is very little configuration involved in `sbt-tasks` but you can currently modify the default package that `sbt-tasks`
will look for `Tasks` in.  We can extend our example `build.sbt` to achieve this

    import se.yobriefca.SbtTasks._
    ...
    defaultTaskPackage := "errands"
    ...
    installTask("printy")
    ...

So in this case the task resolution on `printy` will look for `errands.Printy`

## Play! 2 Integration

With a simple trait it's possible to gain access to your Play! application within your tasks which allows you to gain
access to its plugins and configuration properties

### Play 2.4 and above

    package tasks

    import play.api._
    import Play.current

    trait PlayTask extends Runnable {
        val env = Environment(new java.io.File("."), this.getClass.getClassLoader, Mode.Dev)
        val context = ApplicationLoader.createContext(env)
        val loader = ApplicationLoader(context)
        val app = loader.load(context)

        def work(): Unit

        def run(): Unit = {
            try {
                Play.start(app)
                work()
            } finally {
                Play.stop(app)
            }
        }
    }

    class PrintyTask extends PlayTask {
        // Note, we use `work` here since the PlayTask trait defines `run` for us
        def work() = {
            val configSetting = current.configuration... // get some Play! configuration
            println(configSetting)
        }
    }

### Play 2.3 and below

    import play.core.StaticApplication

    trait PlayTask extends Runnable {
      val application = new StaticApplication(new java.io.File("."))
    }

    class PrintyTask extends PlayTask {
        def run() = {
            val configSetting = application.configuration... // get some Play! configuration
            println(configSetting)
        }
    }
